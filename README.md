# UNITY_GAME_CODE : CROSS AND RUN

# Game Summary - 

The chicken has to cross the street avoiding all obstacles and death trap and of-course it cannot slow down , cause a dragon is chasing  it. 

It have to collect coins (50) to go the next level (Cherryland) from current level (GreenLand) . If it gets hurt, lives are deducted , speed is decreased and the dragon catches up. The score is the calculation of how much forward distance it moves.  Player can die if 1) Dragon chases up (Ghost script for dragon) 2) falls into one of the death traps 3) Lives becomes zero due to multiple accidents . If it collects 50 coins, it will move to the next level. If it collects gift boxes, it will be granted lives.

Game was previously hosted in Google Play Store (had around 3k+ downloads within a year), but had to be removed in 2022, to oblige by UK student VISA regulations.
